# Git Hub Miner
## Background
This is an experimental application created using Git Hub Co-pilot to understand how Python can be used by a developer that has very limited experience of the language.

Typically, becoming comfortable using a new language can take months and months of learning. With GitHub Copilot, I would expect this to take less time to do.

## Where we are now?
### 2nd March 2024
So far, my experiment has been interesting...

As of today, I have spent in the region of about 7 hours of my own time to create a solution which collects information from a number of different repositories in GitHub and puts this information into a text file.

# Quality
As with any other software solution, quality is important to me. I have used SonarCloud to look at the quality of the code and feedback on various aspects of code quality. The following are badges that are updated based on code that has been added to the master branch.
